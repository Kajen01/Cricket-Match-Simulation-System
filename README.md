C++ application of a Cricket Match Simulation System

Project Description: The Cricket Match Simulation System is a C++ application that allows users to simulate a cricket match between two teams. Users can input team and player details, including roles like Batsman, Bowler, and WicketKeeper, along with their specific statistics. The simulation runs for two innings, generating random runs and wickets, and updates a scoreboard that displays the performance of both teams. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles and offers a fun and educational experience for cricket enthusiasts, with potential for future enhancements like a graphical user interface and real-time statistics.
